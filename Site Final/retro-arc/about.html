        <h1>About Retro-Arc</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Retro-Arc, a great pathway for playing retro games! we want to bring back the nostalgia of delisted games by preserving and providing retro games for the cost of "Game Points" earned through playing games and reaching highscores.</p>
        <p>We provide these games for cheap GP prices, some of them even being free for simple gameplay, but if you wish so, you can support us by buying the <a href="fullpack.html">Old Bagger</a> pack to unlock every game we have for free!</p>
        <p>A team founded by a group of passionate fans and gamers, We seek to unite fans of classic games they used to or desire to experience them without much effort in a safe way, which means, no risk from having to download torrents on sketchy websites.</p>
        <p>We do not sell our games for real life money, but we rather can't distribute them for free either, so we use those game points to gain clout from user engagement, meaning the more they play our games, the more income we get. But don't you worry about that! the game points are not too grindy so it's won't a tedius experience.</p>
        <p>If you're interested in joining the team, provide more classic games or help us improve our work, feel free to visit the contact page so we can discuss, your feedback is very important, it helps us improve our website and the games we provide for your pleasure. So we're always open to it</p>
